## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, confirm:

- [ ] My change is scoped and focused on one thing
- [ ] I tested the feature locally and it works as expected
- [ ] I did not break any existing functionality

- [ ] I've updated documentation where relevant
- [ ] PR description explains what changed and why

## Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code must be typed. Avoid `any` where possible.
- **Components**: Keep components focused. Extract if a component exceeds ~150 lines.
- **State management**: Use `useState` and `useEffect` with clear dependency arrays. Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **API routes**: Validate inputs, handle all error paths, return consistent response shapes.
- **Security**: Never log secrets. Never expose server-side keys to the client.

## Beginner-Friendly Issues

- Well-scoped and clearly described
- Don't require deep codebase knowledge
- Reviewed and merged quickly
