## The Problem

Every AI chat app has the same flaw: **long conversations become unusable.**

- You lose track of what was said 40 messages ago.
- You can't jump back to a key decision point.
- Your context disappears when you close the tab.
- You have no control over which AI model or key is used.
- You start over. Again.

Threadly is built specifically to fix this.

| Bring Your Own Key | ❌ | ✅ BYOK + local storage |
| Prompt library | ❌ | ✅ Saved templates |

## Key Features

### 🧵 Thread Navigation Sidebar
Every user message becomes a clickable anchor. Instantly jump to any point in a long conversation — no scrolling, no searching.

### 🧠 Persistent AI Memory
The AI remembers facts across sessions using a tag-based memory system. Memories are only injected into the prompt when contextually relevant — keeping responses fast even with hundreds of stored facts.

### 🔑 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
Use your own OpenAI API key. Your key is stored locally in the browser — never sent to any server.

### ⚡ Fast Streaming AI
Powered by SambaNova's LLaMA 3.3 70B. Real-time streaming with no perceptible delay.

### 📚 Prompt Library
Save complex, recurring prompts as reusable templates. One click to inject into your next chat.

### ⌨️ Fully Assignable Shortcuts
Right-click any button to assign a custom keyboard shortcut. All shortcuts are visible in Settings → Shortcuts and persist across sessions.

### 📤 Share Any Chat
Generate a public read-only link to any conversation. Useful for sharing AI research, answers, or code sessions.

### 📱 PWA Ready
Install Threadly as a desktop or mobile app. Fully offline-capable UI shell.

### 🔍 Chat Search
Real-time filtering across all your conversations in the navigation sidebar.
