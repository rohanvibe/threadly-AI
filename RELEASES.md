## v1.2.0 — Power User Features
*Planned*

### Added
- Fully assignable keyboard shortcuts for every button (right-click → assign)
- Shortcuts panel in Settings with live editing and "Reset to Defaults"
- Tag-based relative memory system — memories inject only when contextually relevant
- AI can now edit and delete existing memories via `[MEMORY_EDIT]` and `[MEMORY_DELETE]` tags
- AI Memory is now JSONB in Supabase — robust, never double-stringified
- General-purpose AI persona — not locked to a developer niche

### Fixed
- Memory not persisting across sessions (Supabase JSONB parsing bug)
- Fetch failed error when recalling memories from new chats
- Ghost AI messages appearing in UI when API errors occur
- Settings panel silently wiping all memories on open

### Fixed
- Sidebar not closing on mobile after chat selection
