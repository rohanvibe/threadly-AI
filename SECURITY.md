## Security Model

- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced on all database tables.
- The Together AI API key is stored server-side only and never exposed to the client.
- BYOK (user's own OpenAI key) is stored only in the user's browser localStorage and is never sent to any backend server.
- Auth sessions are managed entirely by Supabase Auth.
